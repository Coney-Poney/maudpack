# Configuration

## Keybinds

I highly suggest looking over the keybinds, and resolving the conflicts to prevent
the classic "I meant to pet this cow, not mark a waypoint!" conundrum.

## Figura Ponies

The modpack comes with a few Figura Pony models packed in for your convenience, but
there's also a [set of templates on the Coney Poney GitHub](https://github.com/coney-poney/figura-ponies)
that you can check out for yourself!

All the officially endorsed complete models are in the
[Figura Ponies Community Repository.](https://github.com/coney-poney/figura-ponies-community)
