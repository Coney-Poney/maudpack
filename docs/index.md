Howdy!

This is the documentation for getting Maudpack up and running.

This site serves as a reference to help you get started with
running Maudpack, or realistically any Modrinth modpack for
that matter.

I recommend following these pages in order:

- [Installation](install)

- [Configuration](configuration)

- [Tips and Tricks](tipsandtricks)
