# Installation

Here's how you install Maudpack (as well as any modpack via Modrinth) on the
following launchers:

## 1. Default Launcher

- See [2-3](#2-prism-launcher-recommended). The default Minecraft launcher sucks,
don't use it.

## 2. [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) (Recommended)

- Click on the "Add Instance" button
- Go to the "Modrinth" section
- Search "Maudpack", and install!

## 3. [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/)

- Click on "Packs"
- Select "Modrinth" on the left
- Search "Maudpack", and install!

For more information, check out [Modrinth's official documentation.](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)
