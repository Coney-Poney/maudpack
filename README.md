# WorkingTitle Modpack

This is a modpack meant to serve as the main modpack for the modded Minecraft servers that will eventually be hosted for the [Coney Poney Discord community.](https://discord.gg/D4z7AHwWqD)
It's designed to be full-featured, but performant, with sane defaults that allow for a pleasant modded Minecraft experience out of the box.

## Building the modpack

Using [Packwiz,](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) building the modpack is fairly simple.

In the root directory of this repository, run `packwiz mr export` to export a .mrpack file that you can then import into your launcher of choice.

For more information on how to use Packwiz, visit [their website,](https://packwiz.infra.link/) which has ample documentation on how to use it.
